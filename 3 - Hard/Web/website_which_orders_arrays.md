The goal is to implement the necessary architecture and code to provide an array sorting service.
This has to be done with a simple frontend and backend which allow the end user to input an array and select a sorting algorithm from the ones provided by the service

You have freedom of choice regarding the stack you use as well as how the communication between frontend and backend is handled.

Fancy stuff like exception handling and efficiency of implemented algorithms is a bonus but not necessary.
If you use libraries don't forget to provide the maven or gradle build files. 

Note: Your solution should ask for the least amount of work possible to run and test (ideally just "mvn build" & "mvn run if using springboot for example)

## Requirements
 - Frontend which allows users to input an array and select a sorting algorithm (give at least 5 options)
 - Backend that handles the frontend request and sorts the array with the given algorithm and then returns the sorted array
 - Short documentation/Readme containing instructions on how to run and use your service (especially if using libraries which have to be downloaded)

## Technologies:
You can mix and match from here, or use something else. Consider asking the organizers if you plan on using some dark technology no one knows
 
Here's some examples of the most common frameworks used
 - Python (Full-Stack: Django/Flask/FastApi)
 - Java (Full-Stack: Spring Boot Web)
 - JavaScript/TypeScript (Vue.js, Angular, React)
 - PHP
