The goal here is to create an Arduino project to simulate a smart home.

Some example of features such a house could be provided with are:
 - Temperature measurement and regulation
 - Humidity measurement and regulation
 - Opening/closing main gate
 - Unauthorized access detection

## Requirements
 - Arduino code which simulates a smart home
 - LaTeX report (with source code as well) on where to position sensors and actuators to implement your proposed solution

## Technologies
Not having access to a physical Arduino board requires some workaround like a simulation tool.
As for your choice of IDE, we provide some recommendations below

 - Arduino (Example simulation tool: https://wokwi.com/)
 - Arduino IDE
 - VSCode + Extension (https://docs.wokwi.com/vscode/getting-started and/or https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-arduino)
