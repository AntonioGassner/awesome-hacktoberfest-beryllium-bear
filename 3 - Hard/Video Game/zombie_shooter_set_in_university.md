Using the university building(s) as your setting, implement a First Person Shooter (FPS) in which your enemy are zombies.

Your main limit is time given to implement the solution, so avoid focussing too much on a single part of the game.
The choice of specifics regarding the setting is yours as long as it is set in part of the university ground and it has buildings.
We recommend using the building Polo Lodovici, which is the main building of the Computer science department.

When it comes to functionality the most important elements are moving and shooting. 
Zombies can use rudimentary pathing or none at all given that pathing is renowned for it's technical challenges
