Given a string S of length x, check if it is palindrome or not.

Note: Palindrome means a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. madam or nurses run.

You don't need to read input or print anything. 
Complete a function isPalindrome() which accepts string S and returns an integer value 1 (is a palindrome) or 0 (is not a palindrome)

## Input format:
```
x
S = "exampleString"
```

## Example:

Input: 
```
4
S = "abba"
```

Output: 
```
1
```

Explanation: S is a palindrome


## Example 2:

Input: 
```
3
S = "abc"
```
Output: 
```
0
```
Explanation: S is not a palindrome
