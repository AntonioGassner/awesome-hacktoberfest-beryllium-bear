# Multiplayer zombie FPS
Using the university building(s) as your setting, implement a First Person Shooter (FPS) in which your enemy are zombies.

Your main limit is time given to implement the solution, so avoid focussing too much on a single part of the game.
The main buildings of the Computer science department should be used as a setting. 
This means the old building, Polo Ludovici, as well as the new one and the parking lot in between should be the core of your map.

When it comes to functionality the most important elements are moving and shooting.
Zombies can use rudimentary pathing or none at all given that pathing is renowned for it's technical challenges
