## Groups
We recommend working as a group to tackle Extreme challenges.
These usually require different skillsets and knowledge about different programming languages, frameworks and tools.
Having familiarity with the challenge and some of the tools used is highly recommended.

We recommend forming groups with students of both in masters and bachelors degree.
Having a variety of skills and experiences will be crucial to develop a good solution.

If you want to take part and are having trouble finding a group to join feel free
to ask the organizers, and they will provide help.

## Rules on Pull Request (PR):
- only one PR per challenge will be accepted

## Instructions for groups
- fork the repository (master branch)
- every member of the group should fork the fork and work there
- use the master branch to merge your individual commits
- from the master branch make a single Pull Request to submit your project
