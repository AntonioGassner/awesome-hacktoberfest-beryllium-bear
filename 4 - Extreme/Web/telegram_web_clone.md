# Telegram Web Clone 
In this challenge you are asked to develop a Telegram Web clone.
On the frontend side you need to have a form to select a user U and write a text Message. 
This text Message has to be then sent to the user U.

The backend on the other hand should have APIs which are used to accept request from the frontend and 
functionality necessary to perform those tasks. 
It's here where you have the API calls necessary to integrate your service with Telegram's API. 
To test these functionalities you can check if the message arrived correctly to the user U by using your own Telegram acocunt.
Furthermore, you need a login system which the task to allow users to authenticate, using for example OAuth2 and JWT.

You have freedom of choice regarding the stack you use as well as how the communication between frontend and backend is handled.

Note: Your solution should ask for the least amount of work possible to run and test (ideally just "mvn build" & "mvn run if using springboot for example)
